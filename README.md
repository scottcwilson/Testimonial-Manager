Testimonials Manager for Zen Cart 1.5.5f to 1.5.6 
Tested with php7.1 and php7.2 only
==============
This is a beta test of a Testimonials Manager Module redesigned for Zen Cart 1.5.5f to 1.5.6 with another for ZC1.60 to come.  It's offered here for anyone interested in what I've done on my own site where it's in full use. This version will be supported in the ZenCart Forum, use the github contact address if you need help, have questions or comments or jump to the forum.

This version can be an update to Testimonials Manager. This module lets customers leave Feedback on how the shop performed and how your site worked for them.  As with product reviews we use a star rating and voting system for each feedback. The entire forms, and testimonial system is complete with all new layouts.  I use a default avatar for all reviews and you can easily upload images.  You well need to edit images for avatars or display.

I have only tested and designed this with ZC 1.5.5f to 1.5.6 and starting to look at ZC1.6.0.. I will not down grade the code for sites less then ZC1.5.5f. The template used was the default responsive classic template that comes with ZC 1.5.5f and based on sound responsive design technique.

ABOUT Testimonials Manager
==========================
This module lets my customers leave Feedback for me on how I performed and how my site worked for them.  As with product reviews we use a star rating system, voting system for each feedback. 

Installation Instructions? You should not have any problems.. You can drag and drop most of it, there are some core file edits for links and meta-data fields. 

This is a BETA test and may go through a name change to keep the older Testimonials Manager as is. I would strongly suggested you not run this on a live site until BETA testing is complete. Future updates may require full deletion of past installs with the removal of any existing data tables.  This current version well modify existing testimonial tables and configurations.

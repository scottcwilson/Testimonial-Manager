Contributing to Return Manager

When you're contributing to Return Manager, there are a few rules you should follow. First and foremost, Return Manager should be able to run on PHP5.6 or preferred PHP7.1 or higher. Please keep your temporary files (such as .bak, .~, or even .tmp) out of the project.

How To Contribute
==============
 1)   Fork The Repository (davesaddle/zenReturnManager_BETA)
 2)   Branch It this is because when you do the pull request for it, it includes commits you make after you make the pull request and before the pull request is accepted
 3)   Make Your Changes
 4)   Commit Your Changes
 5)   Do 3 and 4 as Needed
 6)   Push Your Changes Back to GitHub
 7)   Start a Pull Request on the Repository
 8)   make sure you explain what the pull request does

Indentation
==============
With Return Manager, you should use spaces as an indent; tabs should not be used as indentation ever. This comes from Microsoft's C# Coding Conventions. It gets annoying when you have both in there, and it clogs up commit logs trying to fix it. 

Issues
==============
Make sure you

    Describe the problem
    Show how to reproduce it, if applicable
    Explain what you think is causing it, if applicable
    Give a plausible solution

Commits
==============
Commits should be in the present tense, and with Title Capitalization. If needed, a body should be on the next line in normal capitalization. 

Spelling
==============
If there is a typo in the code, pointing it out or fixing it well be acceptable, but some code misspelled words are intentional to make it harder for crackers or hackers or just plan shorthand.  If you never cracked or hack a program, this may sound wired.  Spelling errors in the language files, yes please fix but with the understanding that I expect shop owners to review or edit and add there own idea of life not just copy everyone else. 

Notes
=============
Do not run off and speak in circles! Some do this thinking it makes them sound smarter then they are..
